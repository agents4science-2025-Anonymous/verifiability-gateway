# The Verifiability Gateway - Agents4Science 2025

## Quick Start
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/agents4science-2025-Anonymous/verifiability-gateway

# Run with Docker (recommended)
docker build -t verifiability-gateway .
docker run verifiability-gateway

# Or run locally
pip install -r requirements.txt
bash run.sh
```

## Agent Architecture
The Governance & Policy Synthesis (GPS) Agent autonomously discovered that continuous climate intervention is fundamentally ungovernable due to violation of the Principle of Persistent Excitation. The agent processed 2,547 decisions and analyzed 847 cross-domain patterns.

## Key Results
- Continuous SAI: Non-identifiable (γ² < 0.07)
- Pulsed forcing: Identifiable (γ² > 0.76)
- 17.3× verifiability gap across 8 GeoMIP models

## Reproducibility
All results can be reproduced with `bash run.sh`
